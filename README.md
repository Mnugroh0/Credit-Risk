# **Credit-Risk**
In this project i create machine learning model to predict defaulter or non-defaulter borrowers using LGBM Classifier. Data contains 400k rows and 74 features. <br>
In developing the machine learning model for this project, I took two approach: <br>
1. Where the machine learning can be used for borrower history data without the need for a third party to know the history, in other words, **it only depends on the borrower's input**. 
2. Be aware of Data Leakage. <br>
## **Result**
1. AUC Score - 0.77 
2. Kolmogorov-Smirnov Curve - 0.3851
Both result indicates a good performance in credit risk modelling, usually AUC score 0.7 and KS-curve 0.3.
**Suggestion**
There's still room for improvement model score.
