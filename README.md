# **Credit-Risk**
In this project i create machine learning model to predict defaulter or non-defaulter borrowers using LGBM Classifier. Data contains 400k rows and 74 features. In developing the machine learning model for this project, I took an approach where the machine learning can be used for borrower history data without the need for a third party to know the history, in other words, it only depends on the borrower's input.
